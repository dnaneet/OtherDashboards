Mastery quizzes as a whole were less stressful than traditional exams and more appropriate for a class like this that does not have a lecture-based delivery. Larger teams allowed for team members to specialize in certain tasks and software packages. I did feel that I lost a bit of comprehensive knowledge that would have been gained had I been on a smaller team, but I would definitely preserve 5-6 student teams. Less stress was also the main result of DR1. Teams knew that they were on a good footing with their AMESim models early in the semester and did not have to wait for DR2/week 13 to get major feedback on week 1-6 work."

There's been a lot of talk about answers and people just sharing answers. I like the unlimited attempts because it is way less stressful and allows you to work your way to the right answer if you did not get it the first time.  5-6 member teams were nice too because different people have different workloads at different times or if multiple people were sick we would have more team members to contribute.

The higher number of people in a team made it hard to find a time to meet and work on projects when we had to record or do similar tasks. The design reviews were nice to have feedback, however especially with the second design review there is no opportunity to improve and as such no reason to care about feedback. For instance if a team scored a 2% on DR2, since the final deliverable where they were supposed to address the feedback they got only scores the specific new information added; I.E fatigue, the feedback is almost pointless, and only serves to make the team feel bad about their work on a vague assignment. Here specifically, the claim that the course is structured for design and improvement falls apart for the student as all they get is a ' you did good or bad' and there is no opportunity to do better."

The teams of 5-6 is a good idea in theory, but it leads to less accountability to do work in the group. We understand that we are all adults here trying to reach a common goal, and that means that some weeks are busy. In my experience this semester, those individuals who were busy the first few weeks were ""busy"" all the time. One member of my group did not even show up to class or any meetings in the last 3 weeks. He did nothing with the final poster other than the video. Another individual showed up to class, but was hesitant to do any work, even when others offered to help. In the end, it was a team of 3-4 anyways that was doing all the work. I thought this may have just been my experience, but from talking to colleagues in other groups, it seems to be a common theme. 

Thoughts on mastery quizzes:
Mastery Quizzes with unlimited attempts is very valuable. If I got a question or two wrong, it drove me to find my source of error and fix it for the next attempt. It forced me to work with the given program more, making me more skilled in its use. Also it is more forgiving if, for example, I did not have consistent units and had the wrong order of magnitude. I thought the procedure and content for these quizzes was fair given there are unlimited attempts."
